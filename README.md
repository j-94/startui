## Installation

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```

## Development

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Setup VS code

**Create or edit your `.vscode/settings.json` file with the following code**

```json
{
  "i18n-ally.localesPaths": "src/locales"
}
```

### Storybook

```bash
yarn storybook
```

### Development with [MirageJS](https://miragejs.com/) (mock)

**This is the default behavior.**

Do not set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` variable in the `.env` file at the root of the project.

### Development with a [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) backend

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project with the following content:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

## Show hint on development environments

Setup the `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_ENV_NAME` env variable with the name of the environment.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_ENV_NAME=staging
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_ENV_COLOR_SCHEME=teal
```

## API Documentation

API documentation is accessible by admins in the app with [Swagger-UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-react).
```
yarn docs:build
```
This will build the json documentation from the main file `/src/mocks/openapi/openapi.yaml`.

## Production

### NodeJS (recommended)

```bash
yarn storybook:build # Optional: Will expose the Storybook at `/storybook`
yarn build
yarn start
```
### Static files

```bash
yarn storybook:build # Optional: Will expose the Storybook at `/storybook/index.html`
yarn static:build
```

Then expose the `/out` folder.

üí° You will need to setup your server to rewrite all `/app/*` urls to serve the `app.html` file.

## Technology Choices

### React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library created in 2013 to build
reactive user interfaces. At the time of writing, React is probably the front
end library the most used to create new projects and has a huge community which
is beneficial for the maintainability of the project in terms of developers and
online resources.

### Next.js

Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need
for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart
bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.

[GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) ¬∑ [License MIT](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/license.md)

### React Router

Next.js is bundled with its own router, but at the time of writing those lines,
it does not allow nested routes using a shared layout.

[GitHub](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) ¬∑ [License MIT](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/LICENSE)

### TypeScript

JavaScript is a not typed language. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
is here to help add static type definition. TypeScript helps a lot when it comes
to types, interfaces and define contract between functions which helps a lot for
a reliable documentation. No worry, the TypeScript adoption is incremental and
writing in TypeScript is not mandatory to use Start UI, but it is a good
practice to do so to avoid bugs in the future.

### React Query

[React Query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) is a powerful tool
to do efficient data synchronization for React. No need of Redux
or another global state manager anymore. Usable with [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API),
[`axios`](https://github.com/axios/axios), or [`graphql-request`](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request),
React Query will do the work and is agnostic of the method you will use.

### Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an Open Source tool to help you
develop framework agnostic components in isolation and document them.

### Chakra UI

[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) is a simple, modular, composable and
accessible component library that is highly customizable.
